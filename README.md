# Computational Programming in Chemical Reaction Engineering

## Overview
This project integrates the Runge-Kutta method into computational programming to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) relevant to chemical reaction kinetics. The goal is to develop efficient, modular, and maintainable C++ programs for accurate simulation and visualization of chemical reactions.

## Objectives
1. **Efficient Program Development**:
   - Create modular and maintainable C++ programs using object-oriented principles.
   
2. **Chemical Reaction Simulation**:
   - Apply the Runge-Kutta method to accurately simulate chemical reactions with various kinetics and multi-species interactions.

3. **Accuracy and Visualization**:
   - Ensure accurate and stable numerical solutions with error control mechanisms.
   - Incorporate visualization tools for graphical representation of reaction progress.

## Methodology
The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical technique used to solve ODEs by iterative calculations. Key steps include:
- **Initialization**: Start with an initial value for the dependent variables.
- **Iteration**: Calculate the slope at each iteration and estimate the change in variables over a small interval.
- **Repetition**: Repeat until the desired endpoint or specified number of iterations is reached.

## Results
The developed C++ codes effectively solved chemical reaction equations. The numerical solutions aligned with analytical solutions, demonstrating accuracy through stoichiometric coefficients.

## Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its objectives, providing a robust and versatile C++ program for chemical reaction engineering with:
- Efficient, object-oriented program development.
- Accurate chemical reaction simulation using the Runge-Kutta method.
- Effective visualization tools for monitoring reaction progress.
